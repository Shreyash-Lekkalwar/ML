Energy Consumption Forecasting with XGBoost

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to forecast energy consumption. The dataset used for this project is hourly energy usage data.
Data Visualization

The project starts with visualizing the energy usage over time using line plots. This helps to understand the overall trend and seasonality of the energy consumption.
Train / Test Split

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The split is made at the beginning of the year 2015.
Feature Creation

Various features are created from the datetime index of the dataset such as hour, day of week, quarter, month, year, day of year, day of month, and week of year. These features will help the model capture temporal patterns in energy consumption.
Model Creation

XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, is used to build the forecasting model. The model is trained using the created features as input and the energy consumption as the target variable. Hyperparameters like the number of estimators, maximum depth, and learning rate are tuned for optimal performance.
Feature Importance

After training the model, the importance of each feature is analyzed using the XGBoost feature importance metric. This provides insights into which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.
Forecast on Test

The trained model is then used to forecast energy consumption on the test dataset. The predictions are compared with the actual energy consumption to evaluate the model's accuracy. Visualizations are provided to compare the predicted values with the true values.
Model Evaluation

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the model's performance on the test set. Additionally, the model's errors are analyzed over time to identify any patterns or anomalies in the predictions.

Overall, this project demonstrates how machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost, can be utilized for accurate energy consumption forecasting, which is crucial for various applications in the energy sector.
